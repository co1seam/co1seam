## Hey, I'm Struev Constanine 👋
**Backend Engineer**

I build things with Go. I don’t just write code; I care about how it behaves in production. My focus is on making microservices that are actually maintainable and gRPC APIs that don’t make frontend devs cry.

## 🔭 What I’m actually doing
Scaling AI Infrastructure: Handling the heavy lifting behind high-load AI platforms.

Concurrency & Performance: Designing worker pools and event-driven systems that don't choke under pressure.

Low-level curiosity: Exploring OS primitives and the Go scheduler to write more efficient code.

### 🌱 Outside of code
- Solving algorithms
- Digging into **system engineering with Go** – how OS primitives, schedulers, and concurrency really work
- Building random pet projects that may or may not see the light of production
